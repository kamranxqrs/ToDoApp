## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** H2 / MySQL (Spring Boot JPA compatible)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## How It Works

1. The backend exposes a REST API (`/tasks`) to handle CRUD operations for tasks.
2. The frontend fetches data from the API and dynamically renders the task list.
3. Users can interact with tasks using buttons for editing, deleting, or marking as completed.
4. The filter buttons allow users to quickly switch between all, completed, and pending tasks.
5. Dark mode toggle changes the UI theme and remembers the userâ€™s preference.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
2. Run the Spring Boot backend:
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.
4. Start adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks.
